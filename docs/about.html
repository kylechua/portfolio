            Hi there! My name is Kyle, and I'm an undergraduate sophomore at the University of Southern California. I am currently working on a B.S. in Computer Science and Business Administration.<br/>

            <img id="headshot" src="images/headshot.jpeg" /><br />

            I'm an aspiring web developer currently based in the Los Angeles area. I have experience in full-stack and am constantly looking to learn more and refine my skillset. In my free time I enjoy playing and watching basketball, going to music festivals, and exploring the outdoors<br /><br />

            Feel free to browse my website and check out some of the things I've been working on!
